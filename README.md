## Talks

Your one stop shop for learning everything about Reaqtor, Reaqtive, Nuqleon and Rx.


- [On .NET Live - Scalable event processing with Reaqtor](https://reaqtive.net/talks/on-dotnet-live-scalable-event-processing-with-reaqtor) - In this live session Cecil Phillip was joined by Principal Software Engineer Bart De Smet to learn about the Reaqtor project.

- [Reaqtor - Reliable Rx at Scale for High-performance Event Processing](https://reaqtive.net/talks/reaqtor-reliable-rx-at-scale-for-high-performance-event-processing) -
This talk will explain what makes Reaqtor different from other high-scale event processing systems and also show some of the foundational components that have been released as part of this.

- [Rx as a Service](https://reaqtive.net/talks/rx-as-a-service) - This demo shows how Reaqtor enables us to use an Rx-like event processing model, but in a persistent, reliable, cloud-hosted environment.

- [Durability and Reliability in Reaqtor Subscriptions](https://reaqtive.net/talks/durability-and-reliability-in-reaqtor-subscriptions) - This talk is a continuation of the Rx as a Service talk.

- [How Reaqtor combines reactivity with reliable data processing](https://reaqtive.net/talks/how-reaqtor-combines-reactivity-with-reliable-data-processing) - In this video, Carmel covers reliability in Reaqtor and why it is important.

- [Reactive Extensions for .NET](https://reaqtive.net/talks/reactive-extensions-for-dotnet) - In this talk, Ian Griffiths shows why Rx should be a critical part of any .NET developer's toolbox, and illustrates how the powerful processing and orchestration facilities Rx provides. 

- [Cloud-Scale Event Processing with the Reactive Extensions](https://reaqtive.net/talks/cloud-scale-event-processing-with-the-reactive-extensions) - In this session, Bart shows what it took to bring the concepts of Reactive Extensions (Rx) to the cloud to deal with latency, scale, reliability, and other concerns.

- [Reaqtor & Cortana](https://reaqtive.net/talks/reaqtor-and-cortana) - In this talk Bart De Smet covers Reaqtor and Cortana.

- [AMA: Reactive Extensions & LINQ](https://reaqtive.net/talks/ama-reactive-extensions-and-linq) - In this session at Tech-Ed 2012 Bart De Smet answers questions about Reactive Extensions and LINQ.

- [IQbservable: The Dual of IQueryable](https://reaqtive.net/talks/iqbservable-the-dual-of-iqueryable) - In this video Bart De Smet explains IQbservable and the duality of IQueryable.

- [AMA: C#, Rx, LINQ & Event Processing](https://reaqtive.net/talks/ama-csharp-rx-linq-and-event-processing) - In this AMA, .NET Rocks host Richard Campbell interviewed Bill Wagner and Bart De Smet, and took questions from the audience.
